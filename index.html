            <p>My technical career started in 2013 when I joined DecoPac, Inc. as a PhotoCake Level 2 Technician. In this role, I helped execute several process enhancements in both the office and warehouse. In the office I designed and implemented a digital troubleshooting guide that replaced the outdated and often incorrect paper copies that the PhotoCake Team had been using. In the warehouse, I designed and implemented a color coding structure (for the PhotoCake System build process) this helped streamline the process and ultimately cut time and reduced costs. In 2017, I moved from the PhotoCake department onto the Web Team as a Website Specialist. I joined the team in time to help finish preparing for the relaunch of DecoPac.com. In late 2019, I received a promotion to Customer Technology Solutions Analyst. In this role, I helped document both internal and external user stories which helped guide the path for the relaunch of Cakes.com. Working with our Developers is what sparked my interest in Web Development and programming.
